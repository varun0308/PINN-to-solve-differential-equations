This project explores a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework designed to solve complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). PDEs are critical for modeling physical systems in fields like civil and mechanical engineering, but traditional numerical or analytical methods can be computationally expensive and require significant manual effort.

PINNs embed the governing physical laws directly into the loss function of a neural network, enabling data-efficient and accurate approximation of PDE solutions. This approach offers a scalable alternative to conventional solvers and opens up opportunities for faster, more efficient modeling of real-world phenomena.

Despite their promise, the application of PINNs to PDEs is still underexplored. This repository aims to bridge that gap with a robust, modular framework suitable for research and real-world engineering applications.
